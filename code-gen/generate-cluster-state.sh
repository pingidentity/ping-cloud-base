# Note: This script must be executed within its git checkout tree after switching to the desired branch.
#
# This script may be used to generate the initial Kubernetes configurations to push into the cluster-state repository
# for a particular tenant. This repo is referred to as the cluster state repo because the EKS clusters are always
# (within a few minutes) reflective of the code in this repo. This repo is the only interface for updates to the
# clusters. In other words, kubectl commands that alter the state of the cluster are verboten outside of this repo.
#
# The intended audience of this repo is primarily the Ping Professional Services and Support team, with limited access
# granted to Customer administrators. These users may further tweak the cluster state per the tenant's requirements.
# They are expected to have an understanding of Kubernetes manifest files and kustomize, a client-side tool used to make
# further customizations to the initial state generated by this script.
#
# The script generates Kubernetes manifest files for 4 different environments - dev, test, stage and prod. The
# manifest files for these environments contain deployments of both the Ping Cloud stack and the supporting tools
# necessary to provide an end-to-end solution.
#
# For example, the script produces a directory structure as shown below (files within the sub-directories are omitted
# for brevity):

# Deploying the manifests under the fluxcd directory will bootstrap the cluster with a Continuous Delivery tool called
# flux. Once flux is deployed to the cluster, it will deploy the rest of the ping stack and supporting tools. More
# details on flux may be found here: https://docs.fluxcd.io/
#
# ------------
# Requirements
# ------------
# The script requires the following tools to be installed:
#   - openssl
#   - ssh-keygen
#   - ssh-keyscan
#   - base64
#   - envsubst
#   - git
#
# ------------------
# Usage instructions
# ------------------
# The script does not take any parameters, but rather acts on environment variables. The environment variables will
# be substituted into the variables in the yaml template files. The following mandatory environment variables must be
# present before running this script:
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Variable                    | Purpose
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER   | A user with license to run Ping Software
# PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY    | The key to the above user
#
# In addition, the following environment variables, if present, will be used for the following purposes:
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Variable               | Purpose                                            | Default (if not present)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TENANT_NAME            | The name of the tenant, e.g. k8s-icecream. If      | PingPOC
#                        | provided, this value will be used for the cluster  |
#                        | name and must have the correct case (e.g. PingPOC  |
#                        | vs. pingpoc). If not provided, this variable is    |
#                        | not used, and the cluster name defaults to the CDE |
#                        | name.                                              |

#                        | CDEs e.g. k8s-icecream.com. The tenant domain in   |
#                        | each CDE is assumed to have the CDE name as the    |
#                        | prefix, followed by a hyphen. For example, for the |
#                        | above prefix, the tenant domain for stage is       |
#                        | assumed to be stage-k8s-icecream.com and a hosted  |
#                        | zone assumed to exist on Route53 for that domain.  |
#                        |                                                    |

#                        | deployed. For PCPT, this is a required parameter   |

# SIZE                   | Size of the environment, which pertains to the     | small
#                        | number of user identities. Legal values are        |

#                        | test, stage and prod. The domain names for the     |
#                        | CDEs are derived from the TENANT_DOMAIN variable   |
#                        | as documented above. This flag exists because the  |

#                        | and hosted zone in their Ping IAM account role.    |
