#
# Note: This script must be executed within its git checkout tree after switching to the desired branch.
#
# This script may be used to generate the initial Kubernetes configurations to push into the cluster-state repository
# for a particular tenant. This repo is referred to as the cluster state repo because the EKS clusters are always
# (within a few minutes) reflective of the code in this repo. This repo is the only interface for updates to the
# clusters. In other words, kubectl commands that alter the state of the cluster are verboten outside of this repo.
#
# The intended audience of this repo is primarily the Ping Professional Services and Support team, with limited access
# granted to Customer administrators. These users may further tweak the cluster state per the tenant's requirements.
# They are expected to have an understanding of Kubernetes manifest files and kustomize, a client-side tool used to make
# further customizations to the initial state generated by this script.
#
# The script generates Kubernetes manifest files for 4 different environments - dev, test, stage and prod. The
# manifest files for these environments contain deployments of both the Ping Cloud stack and the supporting tools
# necessary to provide an end-to-end solution.
#
# For example, the script produces a directory structure as shown below (Directories greater than a depth of 3 and
# files within the directories are omitted for brevity):
#
# ├── cluster-state
# │  └── k8s-configs
# │     ├── dev
# │     ├── prod
# │     ├── stage
# │     └── test
# │  └── profiles
# └── fluxcd
#    ├── dev
#    ├── prod
#    ├── stage
#    └── test
#
# Deploying the manifests under the fluxcd directory for a specific environment will bootstrap the cluster with a
# Continuous Delivery tool. Once the CD tool is deployed to the cluster, it will deploy the rest of the ping stack
# and supporting tools for that environment.
#
# ------------
# Requirements
# ------------
# The script requires the following tools to be installed:
#   - openssl
#   - ssh-keygen
#   - ssh-keyscan
#   - base64
#   - envsubst
#   - git
#
# ------------------
# Usage instructions
# ------------------
# The script does not take any parameters, but rather acts on environment variables. The environment variables will
# be substituted into the variables in the yaml template files. The following mandatory environment variables must be
# present before running this script:
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Variable                    | Purpose
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER   | A user with license to run Ping Software
# PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY    | The key to the above user
#
# In addition, the following environment variables, if present, will be used for the following purposes:
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Variable                 | Purpose                                            | Default (if not present)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TENANT_NAME              | The name of the tenant, e.g. k8s-icecream. If      | First segment of the TENANT_DOMAIN
#                          | provided, this value will be used for the cluster  | value. E.g. it will default to "ci-cd" 
#                          | name and must have the correct case (e.g. ci-cd    | for tenant domain "ci-cd.ping-oasis.com"
#                          | vs. CI-CD).                                        |
#                          |                                                    |

#                          | each CDE is assumed to have the CDE name as the    |
#                          | prefix, followed by a hyphen. For example, for the |
#                          | above suffix, the tenant domain for stage is       |
#                          | assumed to be stage-k8s-icecream.com and a hosted  |
#                          | zone assumed to exist on Route53 for that domain.  |
#                          |                                                    |
