# This file separates the Ping applications into their individual components so that the apps may be rolled out in
# proper dependency order, especially when their versions are changing.

# For example, pingaccess-was-admin should be upgraded before pingaccess-was engines, so 2 separate rollouts are
# necessary. On the 1st rollout, comment out the "pingaccess-was/engine" line, and on the 2nd rollout, uncomment it.
# It's okay to leave the "pingaccess-was/admin" uncommented out on the 2nd rollout since its deployment should be
# idempotent. After all the application are updated, reset this file back to its original contents.

# NOTE: Before upgrading Beluga from one version to another, the default poll interval of the CD tool may temporarily
# need to be increased so that it doesn't interfere with changes that are still being made to the cluster-state-repo.
# So the steps should be:
#
#   - Update the APP_RESYNC_SECONDS environment variable in k8s-configs/base/cluster-tools/kustomization.yaml to
#     increase the sync interval of the CD tool.
#   - Wait for the CD replicas to be rolled out.
#   - Update the cluster-state-repo to the new Beluga version. Refer to the upgrade doc for the Beluga release for
#     more details.
#   - Make changes to this file to roll out the app updates in the right order.
#   - Reset the APP_RESYNC_SECONDS to the original default of "60" seconds. To make it immediately effective, issue
#     a sync to the CD tool.
#   - Continue making changes to this file until all apps are updated.

# WARNING!!!
#
# Exposing the pingdataconsole in production is not recommended. The console resources only exist for debugging
# Delegated Admin configuration. Do NOT make any configuration changes via the data console. That can cause errors
# while applying future updates through the cluster-state repo.
#
# To deploy the console, uncomment the following line. Once debugging is complete, comment it out once again. To login
# into the admin console, use "pingdirectory:1636" for the Server field and "administrator/<default-password>"
# for the Username/Password fields.
