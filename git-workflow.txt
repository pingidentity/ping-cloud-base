We have been releasing on a monthly cadence. So we have multiple development branches, instead of a single "master"
branch like some of the other products that have a longer release cycle do, e.g. PingDirectory, which follows a loose
quarterly release schedule.

We also follow semantic versioning (semver.org), which states:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

This also results in more frequent versions and branches to track those versions.

Branching and tagging:

Release branches are created after we release a particular version and commit to the next release as a team. They are
typically created from the HEAD of the master branch, but on rare occasions, they may also be created from any prior
commit SHA. This decision is based on team input, release schedules and deadlines. Release branches have a pattern of
"v<major>.<minor>-release-branch", e.g. v1.3-release-branch. Once a release has been qualified by the QA team, the
release tag is created off of the tip of the release branch. There is a tagging script under the build directory to
do that.

This release strategy implies that you can develop code for (and potentially deliver) different major/minor versions
in parallel. For example, you can develop for v1.3.2 and a future v1.4.0 in parallel because they live in separate
release branches. However, maintenance releases on top of a minor release can only be developed sequentially. For
example, you cannot push changes for v1.3.3 into the v1.3-release-branch until v1.3.2 has been tagged. Note that
changes that do not have a known release version may be merged into master.

Once a change has been made to a lower branch, it must be promoted to higher branches. The developer has the choice of
doing it themselves via the MR workflow (as described in the following section), or may defer it to the release
engineer to handle it. A release engineer will merge changes from lower branches all the way up into master
periodically, for example, from v1.3-release-branch -> v1.4-release-branch -> master. Multiple commits may be chained
to keep the CI pipeline from going berserk. But if it's not a fast-forward merge, and there are merge conflicts, the
release engineer may request the developer to perform the merge.

Note that the release branches are not long-lived branches. Once a particular version has been made end-of-life, or all
customers have been upgraded to a new version, the release branches may be deleted. For example, if all PingCloud
customers have moved onto v1.3.1, the v1.1-release-branch and v1.2-release-branch branches may be deleted.

Git Workflow:

1. When working on a bug or feature, the first thing to determine is the version for which it is targeted. Ask a
   team member if this is not clear.

2. Find out which branch corresponds to that version in ping-cloud-base on GitLab. Ask a team member if this is
   not clear.

3. After cloning ping-cloud-base, create a local feature/bug-fix branch. For example, to create a new local bug-fix
   branch named pdo-288-increase-csd-timeout off of the current tip of the v1.3-release-branch, run these commands:

   git clone git@gitlab.corp.pingidentity.com:ping-cloud-private-tenant/ping-cloud-base.git
   git checkout v1.3-release-branch              # Switch to the v1.3-release-branch
   git pull                                      # Get the latest changes from the server
   git checkout -b pdo-288-increase-csd-timeout  # Create the feature or bug-fix branch

   Note: We use branch names to create unique DNS names on Route53 for each environment. DNS names must be 63
   characters or shorter. So the branch name must not be too long such that it exceeds that limit. The maximum
   recommended length for the branch name is 40 characters. A best-practice is to use the Jira issue number as the
   branch name prefix, followed by a short description, e.g. pdo-723-wait-for-services.

4. Make your changes on your local branch. Periodically merge the source branch into your local branch. This is
   especially important for massive changes.

   git stash                         # This is only required if you have uncommitted changes in your branch
   git checkout v1.3-release-branch  # Switch to the source branch, v1.3-release-branch
   git pull                          # Fetch and merge the latest updates from the server into v1.3-release-branch
   git checkout -                    # Switch back to the previous branch, e.g. pdo-288-increase-csd-timeout
   git stash pop                     # This is only required if you had uncommitted changes
   git merge v1.3-release-branch     # Merge the changes from the v1.3-release-branch into your branch

   At this point, you may have merge conflicts if another developer has updated one or more of the same files that you
   have. You'll have to resolve them using a three-way merge tool. Most IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) have plugins to do
   this.

5. Repeat step 4 until you're done implementing and testing the feature or bug fix.

6. Push to the server when you're done. Git best practices dictate that you only push your changes after you've tested
   your feature branch, i.e. try not to commit, then push repeatedly. Every push will trigger a pipeline on the server,
   which will flood the shared CI/CD cluster.

   Note: We currently have a unique situation with server profiles. If your change encompasses server profiles, then
   you must push your branch for it to be mirrored onto AWS Code Commit so that your containers running on AWS EKS can
   clone your branch with your server profile changes. In this case, use a commit message prefix of "[skip pipeline]"
   to avoid triggering a CI/CD pipeline.

7. When finally done with your changes, commit your last changeset without the "[skip pipeline]" message so that a
   CI/CD pipeline gets triggered.

   Note: Without a successful CI/CD pipeline, you will not be able to merge your branch into the target branch on the
   GitLab server.

8. From the GitLab UI, create a Merge Request. Set the target branch for the merge request to your original source
   branch, e.g. v1.3-release-branch. Also check the following boxes:

   - "Squash commits when merge request is accepted" to squash all the commits in your feature branch
   - "Delete source branch when merge request is accepted" to delete the feature branch

   If you'd like a different commit message for the "squashed commit" than the last commit on the branch, then you may
   do so from the MR interface by clicking on the "Override squash commit message" link.

9. Subscribe to the beluga-notifications slack channel to be notified of MRs. Alternately, you may also post the MR to
   the pda-dev channel if you'd like a specific subset of the team to review your changes.

10. Incorporate review feedback in your local feature branch and push those up. They will automatically show up in
    your MR because the MR is associated with your branch.

11. Resolve all threads in the MR. Once approved and the pipeline passes, you will be able to merge your changes to the
    target branch by hitting the "Merge" button.
