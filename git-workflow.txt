We have been releasing on a monthly cadence. So we have multiple development branches, instead of a single "master"
branch like some of the other products that have a longer release cycle do, e.g. PingDirectory, which follows a loose
quarterly release schedule.

We also follow semantic versioning (semver.org), which states:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

This also results in more frequent versions and branches to track those versions.

Git Workflow:

1. When working on a bug or feature, the first thing to determine is the version for which it is targeted. Ask a
   team member if this is not clear.

2. Find out which branch corresponds to that version in ping-cloud-base on GitLab. Ask a team member if this is
   not clear.

3. After cloning ping-cloud-base, create a local feature/bug-fix branch. For example, to create a new local feature
   branch named pdo-288-increase-csd-timeout off of the current tip of the v1.2-release-branch, run these commands:

   git clone git@gitlab.corp.pingidentity.com:ping-cloud-private-tenant/ping-cloud-base.git
   git checkout v1.2-release-branch              # Switch to the v1.2-release-branch
   git pull                                      # Get the latest changes from the server
   git checkout -b pdo-288-increase-csd-timeout  # Create the feature or bug-fix branch

   Note: Use a branch name prefix of "profile-test-" *only* if your change encompasses server profiles. These are
   protected branches that only the repository maintainer can delete. In the future, when we have immutable images,
   we will not need server profiles and will get rid of the "profile-test-" protected branch.

4. Make your changes on your local feature branch. Periodically merge the source branch into your local branch. This is
   especially important for massive changes.

   git stash                         # This is only required if you have uncommitted changes in your branch
   git checkout v1.2-release-branch  # Switch to the source branch, v1.2-release-branch
   git pull                          # Fetch and merge the latest updates from the server into v1.2-release-branch
   git checkout -                    # Switch back to the previous branch, e.g. pdo-288-increase-csd-timeout
   git stash pop                     # This is only required if you had uncommitted changes
   git merge v1.2-release-branch     # Merge the changes from the v1.2-release-branch into your feature branch

   At this point, you may have merge conflicts if another developer has updated one or more of the same files that you
   have. You'll have to resolve them using a three-way merge tool. Most IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) have plugins to do
   this.

5. Repeat step 4 until you're done implementing and testing the feature or bug fix.

6. Push to the server when you're done. GitLab best practices dictate that you only push your changes after you've
   tested your feature branch, i.e. try not to commit, then push repeatedly. Every push will trigger a pipeline on the
   server, which will flood the shared CI/CD cluster.

   Note: We currently have a unique situation with the profile-test-* branches. We must push this branch for it to be
   mirrored onto GitHub and externally available so that your containers running on EKS can clone your branch with your
   server profile branches. In this case, use a commit message prefix of "[skip pipeline]" to avoid triggering a CI/CD
   pipeline.

7. When finally done with your changes, commit your last changeset without the "[skip pipeline]" message so that a
   CI/CD pipeline gets triggered.

8. From the GitLab UI, create a Merge Request. Set the target branch for the merge request to your original source
   branch, e.g. v1.2-release-branch. Also check the following boxes:

   - "Squash commits when merge request is accepted" to squash all the commits in your feature branch
   - "Delete source branch when merge request is accepted" to delete the feature branch

   Note: The "Delete source branch when merge request is accepted" checkbox will not be available for protected
   branches (e.g. profile-test-* branches). In that case, tell the project maintainer to delete it for you after the MR
   is merged.

   If you'd like a different commit message for the "squashed commit" than the last commit on the branch, then you may
   do so from the MR interface by clicking on the "Override squash commit message" link.

9. Subscribe to the beluga-notifications slack channel to be notified of MRs. Alternately, you may also post the MR to
   the pda-dev channel if you'd like a specific subset of the team to review your changes.

10. Incorporate review feedback in your local feature branch and push those up. They will automatically show up in
    your MR because it is associated with your branch.

11. Resolve all threads in the MR. Once approved and the pipeline passes, you will be able to merge your changes to the
    target branch by hitting the "Merge" button.
