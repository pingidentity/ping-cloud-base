# This patch may be applied to the pingdirectory statefulset to start up a sidecar container that'll tunnel TLS
# traffic. Since nginx is simply a web proxy and cannot handle proxying anything but HTTPS traffic, this is necessary
# for the pingdirectory LDAPS server.

# This patch requires a secret object of the name pointed by the K8S_ACME_CERT_SECRET_NAME environment variable to
# exist. This is usually created by cert-manager, which interacts with Let's encrypt to issue an ACME certificate.
# For BYOC use cases, the secret may be created declaratively with the tls.crt and tls.key that contains the identity
# certificate and key in base64-encoded PEM format.
