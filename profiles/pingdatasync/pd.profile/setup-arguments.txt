# These arguments are passed in to the server's setup tool when manage-profile
# setup is run. The PING_SERVER_ROOT and PING_PROFILE_ROOT variable values are
# provided, but if the PING_INSTANCE_NAME variable is used, it will need to be
# provided through environment variables or a profile variables file passed in
# to the manage-profile tool.
#
# In these example arguments, the PingDirectory.lic license file will need to
# be available in the server root. It can be added to the server-root/pre-setup
# directory in the profile to be copied to the server before these arguments are
# used.
#
# In these example arguments, a password and passphrase file are expected in the
# misc-files directory of the profile. These files would only need to be present
# when manage-profile setup is run and can be deleted after the tool completes.
# An alternative for non-production environments is to not use password files.
# For example, the root user password could be directly provided with the
# --rootUserPassword argument, and the --encryptDataWithRandomPassphrase
# argument can be used to encrypt data with a randomly generated key.
